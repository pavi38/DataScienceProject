# How to use:

1. If you want to download and preprocess the images, go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification?resource=download and download the dataset into the data_raw folder,<br><br>
then run the Data_cleanup.py file<br><br>
Alternatively, if you want to preprocess the images and train a model of your own, run the GNN_Training.py file instead.

2. If you want to visualize how the images are segmented and turned into graphs, run the Data_Visualization.py file.

3. If you want to use the pretrained model, run the Model_Predict.py file. It will automatically open the prediction images dataset and run the model on 10 of them.
note: If you would like to input your own images given a URL, change the 'which' variable on line 18 in Model_Predict.py from 'pred' to 'url'

4. If you want to train your own model with new parameters, change the parameters for processing the images or for the model in HyperParameters.py. Edits to the topology of the model can be made in the GNN_Model.py file.
note: If you want to train/run your own new model, you can name it in the HyperParameters.py file (MODEL_NAME variable)
